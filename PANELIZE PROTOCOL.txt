S1.A COLLECT 2D COORDINATES OF ALL COLUMN SUPPORTS 
	B. DEFINE THE SLAB BOUNDARY 

S2 GENERATE PERPENDICULAR BISECTORS 
	A.DRAW LINE SEGMENT CONNECTING THE TWO COLUMNS
	B.CONSTRUCT PERPENDICULAR BISECTOR OF THE SEGMENT 
	C.REPEAT FOR ALL ADJACENT PAIRS(BASED ON DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION OR VISUAL ADJECENCY IN THE SLAB)

S3 BUILD TRIBUTARY POLYGONS(VORONI-LIKE REGIONS)
	A.AT EACH COL ENCLOSE IT WITH BISECTORS BETWEEN IT AND ITS NEIGHBORING COL
	B.THE RESULTING POLYGON DEFINES THE REGION OF SLAB THAT BELONGS TO THAT COLUMN

S4 CALCULATE AREA
